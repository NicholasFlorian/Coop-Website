					<p1 class="blog-main">Generic work behavior is defined as behavior that contributes to the performance of virtually any job independent of technical job roles. Variations in generic work behavior are primarily dependent on differences in volition, and the effects of generic work behavior are likely to be the most prevalent in jobs where performance does not depend heavily on job‐specific knowledge, skills, or ability. Analysis of supervisor ratings of specific employee behaviors gathered from 18,146 employees in 42 different hourly, entry‐level jobs in predominantly retail settings suggests the existence of at least eight specific dimensions of generic work behavior: industriousness, thoroughness, schedule flexibility, attendance, off‐task behavior, unruliness, theft, and drug misuse. These components were integrated with performance components identified in previous studies to develop a taxonomy of generic work behavior. Implications of this taxonomy for the measurement, prediction, and conceptualization of job performance are discussed.</p1>
